It's time to jingle and mingle with our friends and neighbours again!

Join us on Saturday, December the 3rd and sing along with our fabulous choir, enjoy a drink of hot chocolate or mulled wine and tuck into mince pies, jacket potatoes and chilli (veggie or meaty). 

Join in the gingerbread man decorating and Christmas hat competition! 

The road will be closed from 2:00pm to 10:00pm in front of No. 1 to No. 8 Newlands Close.
