Join us on Saturday, December the 3rd and sing along with our fabulous choir, enjoy a drink of hot chocolate or mulled wine and tuck into mince pies, jacket potatoes and chilli (veggie or meaty). 

Play games and join in the gingerbread man decorating and Christmas hat competition! 

The road will be closed from 2:00pm to 10:00pm in front of No. 1 to No. 8 Newlands Close.

Schedule: 
* 4.30pm - Start (Christmas music, mulled wine, minced pies)

We are also fundraising for [The Monday Group](https://mondaygroup.org/)! During our last event we raised £70.40, which went towards improvements of the Roman Road footpath between Keymer and Ditchling. All donations help!
